> Wig is under active development. Some features may be incomplete or unstable.

## Description

Wig is a minimal but fully functional web browser.

It is built around [`WPEPlatformGTK`](https://github.com/Igalia/wpe-platform-gtk), which handles fetching, parsing, and rendering web pages, and provides a GTK widget that can be integrated with a minimal amount of code.

The user interface is implemented using GTK and Libadwaita and includes common web browser features such as tab-based navigation.
